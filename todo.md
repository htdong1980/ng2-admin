// NOTES: NOT LEAVE THE comma at the end element of object of en.json

[DONE] Change box page to be AdminLTE page
[DONE] Register, Login, Page404, Page500

[TODO] Page404 and Page500 conflict at two level Pages and Above

Separate AdminLTE styles into smaller component in box page
- Box similar to Blank page
- Info box type 1
- Info box type 2
- Info box type 3: Small box  
- Social widget

Port AdminLTE to Ng2-Admin does not have much meaning
BUT learn Ng2-Admin way to create directives using AdminLTE styles make sense
In addition, should focus on v1. Ng2-Admin Styles, it's opaque is better than AdminLTE

Other component pending next time
- Alert
- Callout
- Tab
- Accordian
- Timeline
-
