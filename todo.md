[DONE] Change box page to be AdminLTE page
Separate AdminLTE styles into smaller component in box page
- Box similar to Blank page
- Info box type 1
- Info box type 2
- Info box type 3: Small box  
- Social widget

Port AdminLTE to Ng2-Admin does not have much meaning
BUT learn Ng2-Admin way to create directives using AdminLTE styles make sense
In addition, should focus on v1. Ng2-Admin Styles, it's opaque is better than AdminLTE

Other component pending next time
- Alert
- Callout
- Tab
- Accordian
- Timeline
-
